===========

This aims to be an overview over the ecosystem of editors
and IDEs for Rust coding.


How 2 contribute?
-----------------

Open an issue in the issue tracker,
write me in IRC (same nickname),
or fork the repository, edit and compile `index.jade` and send a pull request.

(Yes, yes, index.html is committed in the repo, just for convenience)


Licence
-------

I've chosen the CC-by licence, as it seemed to be the most permissive and appropriate one.
